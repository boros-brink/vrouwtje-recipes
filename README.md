# vrouwtje-recipes

This is my first actual project since I have started learning web development. I've been learning the basics of HTML which I will put to the test today. But that's not the only thing I've learned along the way. I've also been working with Git and Github, and I've set up a nice environment for myself to work in (text editors etc.). I'm working on Linux and trying to use the CLI (command line interface) as much as possible. This is going to be a very basic website with some recipes on it. The next paragraph will be my reflection after I've finished the project. This is just a foreword of where my skills currently are, and what I expect to do with them. For now my goals are to be able to list items, put some links up, and add some images. We'll see how it goes!
